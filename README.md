## Description
Beatblendr is a web application that allows you to create/delete playlists, and add/delete songs to/from those playlists. It is automatically uploaded to your real spotify account.
Must sign in to a real spotify account to use BeatBlendr. (Because of the way the API works)

## Please use the Test Account to Sign In
At the bottom of the README, there are login details on the account to use when using the application.
Because of the way the Spotify API works, I can only have registered users access the functions of the app unless I get the app approved by Spotify.

## To Run on Localhost
Please go onto the LandingPage.tsx component and change REDIRECT_URI to whichever url applies. There are comments below the variable that you can copy and paste to set the right URI. (Default is the vercel link)
Command to run is:
1. yarn run dev
